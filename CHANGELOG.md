## [2.0.4] - 2026-02-06

v2.0.4 Cleanup Sprint: Resolve all open bugs and actionable tech debt (PLAN-003).

### Fixed

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure + Documentation
- **BUG-060**: Grafana dashboards using wrong metric prefix (`ai_memory_` → `aimemory_`)
  - Updated 10 dashboard JSON files with correct `aimemory_` prefix per BP-045
- **BUG-061**: Grafana dashboards using `rate[5m]` which shows nothing with infrequent pushes
  - Switched to `increase[1h]` for counter panels across all dashboards
- **BUG-063**: Hardcoded bcrypt hash in `docker/prometheus/web.yml`
  - Replaced with valid bcrypt hash, cleaned comments
- **TECH-DEBT-078**: Docker `.env.example` had real credentials as placeholder values
  - Replaced with safe placeholder values
- **TECH-DEBT-081**: Grafana dashboard panels showing "No data" (auto-resolved by BUG-060/061 fixes)
- **TECH-DEBT-093**: No authentication on Prometheus web interface
  - `web.yml` now references valid bcrypt hash for basic auth
- **TECH-DEBT-140**: Classifier metrics missing `project` label for multi-tenancy
  - Added `project` as first label to all 9 classifier Prometheus metrics
  - Updated all 4 helper functions to accept and pass `project` parameter
  - Added defensive `project_name = "unknown"` initialization
- **README accuracy**: 6 factual fixes applied
  - Broken `CLAUDE.md` reference → `CONTRIBUTING.md`
  - Duplicate Quick Start sections consolidated
  - Wrong method name (`send_message_streaming` → `send_message_buffered`)
  - Outdated model IDs (`claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` → `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
  - Python version clarification (3.11+ required for AsyncSDKWrapper)
  - Hook architecture diagram updated (unified keyword trigger, pluralized hook types)

#### Phase 2: Metrics Pipeline + Hook Behavior + Quick Wins
- **BUG-020**: Duplicate SessionStart entries after compact
  - Implemented file-based deduplication lock (session_id + trigger key, 5s expiry)
  - Second execution exits gracefully with empty context
- **BUG-062**: NFR metrics not pushed to Pushgateway
  - All hooks now use `push_hook_metrics_async()` instead of local metrics
- **TECH-DEBT-072**: Collection size metrics not visible in Grafana
  - Monitoring API now pushes `aimemory_collection_size` to Pushgateway
  - Includes both total and per-project breakdown
- **TECH-DEBT-073**: Missing `hook_type` labels on duration metrics
  - All hooks now push duration with correct `hook_type` label via `track_hook_duration()`
  - SessionStart verified (already correct)
- **TECH-DEBT-074**: Incomplete trigger type labels
  - Verified all trigger scripts push correct `trigger_type` values
- **TECH-DEBT-075**: Missing `collection` label on capture metrics
  - Verified capture hooks pass correct collection parameter
- **TECH-DEBT-085**: Documentation still references "BMAD Memory" product name
  - Renamed product references to "AI Memory" in 6+ docs files
  - Preserved BMAD Method/workflow methodology references
  - Updated env var names, container names, and metric names in docs
- **TECH-DEBT-091**: Logging truncation violates architecture principle
  - Removed `content[:50]` truncation in 2 structured log fields
  - Removed `conversation_context[:200]` truncation in activity log
- **TECH-DEBT-141**: `VALID_HOOK_TYPES` missing 3 hook type values
  - Added `PreToolUse_FirstEdit`, `PostToolUse_Error`, `PostToolUse_ErrorDetection`
- **TECH-DEBT-142**: Hooks using local Prometheus metrics instead of Pushgateway push
  - Converted all hook scripts from local `hook_duration_seconds` to push-based metrics
  - Removed dead local metric imports/definitions from 10 hook scripts

### Changed
- Dashboard hook_type labels standardized to PascalCase across all Grafana panels
- Classifier `record_classification()` and `record_fallback()` now require `project` parameter
- Monitoring API `update_metrics_periodically()` now pushes to Pushgateway alongside in-process gauges

### Known Gaps
- **TECH-DEBT-077** (partial): `/save-memory` has activity logging; `/search-memory` and `/memory-status` skills are markdown-only with no hook scripts to add logging to. Deferred to future sprint.

## 2.0.3 - 2026-02-05

### Changed
- Hook commands now use venv Python: `$AI_MEMORY_INSTALL_DIR/.venv/bin/python`
- `docker/.env.example` reorganized with quick setup guide and sync warnings
- Metrics renamed from `ai_memory_*` to `aimemory_*` (BP-045 compliance)
- All metrics now include `project` label for multi-tenancy
- NFR-P2 and NFR-P6 now have separate metrics (was shared)
- All hooks now push project label to metrics (TECH-DEBT-124)
- Hook labels standardized to CamelCase ("SessionStart", "PreToolUse_NewFile")

### Added
- Venv health check function in `health-check.py` (TECH-DEBT-136)
- Venv verification during installation with fail-fast behavior
- Troubleshooting documentation for dependency issues
- Best practices research: BP-046 Claude Code hooks Python environment
- NFR-P3 dedicated metric: `aimemory_session_injection_duration_seconds`
- NFR-P4 dedicated metric: `aimemory_dedup_check_duration_seconds`
- Grafana V3 dashboards: NFR Performance, Hook Activity, Memory Operations, System Health
- BP-045: Prometheus metrics naming conventions documentation
- `docs/MONITORING.md`: Comprehensive monitoring guide
- TECH-DEBT-100: Log sanitization with `sanitize_log_input()`
- TECH-DEBT-104: content_hash index for O(1) dedup lookup
- TECH-DEBT-111: Typed events (CaptureEvent, RetrievalEvent)
- TECH-DEBT-115: Context injection delimiters `<retrieved_context>`
- TECH-DEBT-116: Token budget increased to 4000
- Prometheus Dockerfile with entrypoint script for config templating

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Hook Python interpreter path** (TECH-DEBT-135)
  - Hooks were configured to use system `python3` instead of venv interpreter
  - This caused ALL hook dependencies to be unavailable (qdrant-client, prometheus_client, tree-sitter, httpx, etc.)
  - **Symptoms**: Silent failures, `ModuleNotFoundError` in logs, memory operations not working, "tree-sitter not installed" warnings
  - **Root Cause**: `generate_settings.py` used bare `python3` instead of `$AI_MEMORY_INSTALL_DIR/.venv/bin/python`
  - **Action Required for Existing Installations**: Re-run `./scripts/install.sh` to regenerate `.claude/settings.json` with correct Python path
- **Hook metrics missing collection label** (TECH-DEBT-131)
  - `memory_captures_total` metric expected 4 labels but hooks only passed 3
  - Caused `ValueError` after successful storage (data saved but error logged)
  - Fixed in 5 async storage scripts (19 total label additions)
- **Venv verification added to installer** (TECH-DEBT-136)
  - Installer now verifies venv creation and critical package imports
  - Fails fast with clear error message if dependencies unavailable
  - Added troubleshooting documentation
- **Classifier metrics prefix** (TECH-DEBT-128)
  - Migrated `classifier/metrics.py` from `ai_memory_classifier_*` to `aimemory_classifier_*` per BP-045
  - Updated legacy dashboards (classifier-health.json, memory-overview.json) to match
- **Docker environment configuration** (TECH-DEBT-127)
  - Created `docker/.env` with all required secrets
  - Enhanced `docker/.env.example` with generation commands and sync warnings
  - Fixed Grafana security secret key configuration
- **BUG-019**: Metrics were misleading (shared metrics for different NFRs)
- **BUG-021**: Some metrics not collecting (missing NFR-P4, wrong naming)
- **BUG-059**: restore_qdrant.py snapshot restore now works correctly
- **#13**: E2E test now uses `--project` argument or current working directory
- **CI Tests**: Fixed test_monitoring_performance.py label mismatches:
  - Added missing `collection` label to `memory_captures_total` test calls
  - Added missing `status`, `project` labels to `hook_duration_seconds` test calls
  - Reformatted with black 26.1.0 (was using 25.12.0 locally)
  - Changed upload from PUT to POST with multipart/form-data (Qdrant 1.16+ API)
  - Fixed recover endpoint to use `/snapshots/recover` with JSON body location
  - Added `create_collection_for_restore()` for fresh install support
  - Removed collection deletion before upload (was causing 404 errors)

## [2.0.2] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **BUG-054**: Installer now runs `pip install` for Python dependencies
- **BUG-051**: SessionStart hook timeout parameter cast to int (was float)

- **15 Memory Types** for precise categorization
- **5 Automatic Triggers** (error detection, new file, first edit, decision keywords, best practices)

- **Disk space check**: Fixed crash when installation directory doesn't exist yet
- **Qdrant health check**: Fixed incorrect health endpoint (was `/health`, now `/`)
- **Progress indicators**: Added elapsed time display during service startup

### Added
