## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **BUG-059**: restore_qdrant.py snapshot restore now works correctly
  - Changed upload from PUT to POST with multipart/form-data (Qdrant 1.16+ API)
  - Fixed recover endpoint to use `/snapshots/recover` with JSON body location
  - Added `create_collection_for_restore()` for fresh install support
  - Removed collection deletion before upload (was causing 404 errors)

## [2.0.2] - 2026-02-03

### Fixed
- **BUG-054**: Installer now runs `pip install` for Python dependencies
- **BUG-051**: SessionStart hook timeout parameter cast to int (was float)
- **BUG-058**: store_async.py handles missing session_id gracefully with .get() fallback

### Added
- `scripts/backup_qdrant.py` - Database backup with manifest verification
- `scripts/restore_qdrant.py` - Database restore with rollback on failure
- `scripts/upgrade.sh` - Upgrade script for existing installations
- `docs/BACKUP-RESTORE.md` - Complete backup/restore documentation
- `backups/` directory for storing backups outside install location

### Changed

- 66 files reformatted with black 26.1.0

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added
- **V2.0 Memory System** with 3 specialized collections (code-patterns, conventions, discussions)
- **15 Memory Types** for precise categorization
- **5 Automatic Triggers** (error detection, new file, first edit, decision keywords, best practices)
- **Intent Detection** - Routes queries to the right collection automatically
- **Knowledge Discovery** features:
  - `best-practices-researcher` skill - Web research with local caching
  - `skill-creator` agent - Generates Claude Code skills from research
  - `search-memory` skill - Semantic search across collections
  - `memory-status` skill - System health and diagnostics
  - `memory-settings` skill - Configuration display
- **Quick Start section** in README.md with git clone instructions
- **"Install ONCE, Add Projects" warning** - Prevents common installation mistake
- **Comprehensive hook documentation**: Created `docs/HOOKS.md` documenting all 12+ hooks
- **Slash commands reference**: Created `docs/COMMANDS.md` with Skills & Agents section
- **Configuration guide**: Created `docs/CONFIGURATION.md`

### Changed
- **Major architecture update** - Three-collection system replaces single collection
- **README.md** - Added Quick Start, Knowledge Discovery section, clarified BMAD relationship
- **INSTALL.md** - Added warning about installing once, emphasized cd to existing directory
- **docs/COMMANDS.md** - Added Skills & Agents section (best-practices-researcher, skill-creator, search-memory, memory-status, memory-settings)
- **Repository URLs**: Updated from `[redacted]/ai-memory` to `Hidden-History/ai-memory`

### Fixed
- **PreCompact hook documentation**: Added missing documentation
- **Multi-project installation clarity**: Emphasized using same ai-memory directory

## [1.0.1] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **Embedding model persistence**: Added Docker volume for HuggingFace cache. Model now persists across container restarts (98.7% faster subsequent starts)
- **Installer timeout**: Increased service wait timeout from 60s to 180s to accommodate cold start model downloads (~500MB)
- **Disk space check**: Fixed crash when installation directory doesn't exist yet
- **Qdrant health check**: Fixed incorrect health endpoint (was `/health`, now `/`)
- **Progress indicators**: Added elapsed time display during service startup

### Added
- `requirements.txt` for core Python dependencies
- Progress messages explaining model download during first start

### Changed
- Embedding service health check `start_period` increased to 120s
- Improved error messages with accurate timeouts and troubleshooting steps

## [1.0.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- Initial public release
- One-command installation (`./scripts/install.sh`)
- Automatic memory capture from Write/Edit operations (PostToolUse hook)
- Intelligent memory retrieval at session start (SessionStart hook)
- Session summarization at session end (Stop hook)
- Multi-project isolation with `group_id` filtering
- Docker stack: Qdrant + Jina Embeddings + Streamlit Dashboard
- Monitoring: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
- Deduplication (content hash + semantic similarity)
- Graceful degradation (Claude works without memory)
- Comprehensive documentation (README, INSTALL, TROUBLESHOOTING)
- Test suite: Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance
