# Prometheus Web Configuration - Basic Authentication
# Generated for AI Memory Module (TECH-DEBT-076)
# Best Practice: BP-040 (Docker Service Authentication)
#
# Username: admin
# Password: Set in docker/.env as PROMETHEUS_ADMIN_PASSWORD
# Bcrypt hash generated with cost factor 12
#
# To regenerate hash:
#   python3 -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw(b'your_password', bcrypt.gensalt(12)).decode())"
#
# IMPORTANT:
# - This file is read on EVERY HTTP request (changes apply immediately, no restart needed)
# - All Prometheus endpoints require auth when enabled (including /metrics, /targets, /graph)
# - Grafana datasource must include basicAuth credentials to access Prometheus
