# Prometheus Web Configuration - Basic Authentication
#
# WARNING: This is a placeholder file.
# The actual bcrypt hash is generated during installation from PROMETHEUS_ADMIN_PASSWORD.
#
# If you see "unauthorized" errors in Grafana:
#   1. Ensure PROMETHEUS_ADMIN_PASSWORD is set in docker/.env
#   2. Re-run the installer to regenerate this file
#   3. Or manually generate: python3 -c "import bcrypt; print(bcrypt.hashpw(b'PASSWORD', bcrypt.gensalt(12)).decode())"
#
# This file is overwritten by install.sh with the correct bcrypt hash.
